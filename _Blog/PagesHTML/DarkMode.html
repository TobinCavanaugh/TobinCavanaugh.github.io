    <h1>DarkMode and LightMode</h1>

    <p>The use of darkmode versus the use of lightmode is one of the most hotly argued, yet inconsequential topics the internet has seen... apart from the entirety of twitter.</p>

    <p>Every program nowadays <b>must</b> have the capability for both, or at the very least a dark mode.</p>

    <p>This isn't a huge problem... but why dark mode?</p>

    <boxed>Reasons:</boxed>
    <ul>
        <li>Ease of viewing</li>
        <li>Battery life</li>
        <li>Style</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While these are genuine reasons. The fact of the matter is that dark mode isn't required, but rather preferred in these scenarios.</p>

    <p>No-one disagrees with the fact that pure html (no css) sites are not enjoyable to look at, at least when you're programming at night. The real solution here, is not to invert the webpages colors, or implement a system of switching light and dark. It's sane defaults.</p>

    <p>In a perfect world, much of our current technology would be rebuilt from scratch to circumvent technical debt. This deserves an article of it's own, but, a simple and easy thing we could do, would be to change the defaults for new webpages.</p>

    <p>This could solve all three reasons people use dark mode, without being entirely destructive.</p>

    <p>Also who the hell decided on Times New Roman as the default font? At least on any computer I've had it always does Times New Roman. I'm reading a post from 1997 about drawing graphics in C, not reading a book from 1887.</p>

    <p>The truth is, web browsers are a bit ridiculous. They're made by people much smarter than you or I (unless you work on web browsers) and do quite a lot. I always wonder if there's a better way. In fact I'm convinced their must be, but I have yet to do it.</p>
