    </h2>

    <p>A simple .c and .h file for making mutable strings in pure C</p>

    <blockquote>

        - Pure C Strings using char arrays inside of a special struct named PureString. <br><br>


        - The main concept is to create a system of easy to mutate strings, that is reasonably quick and effective. <br><br>


        - Everything has been manually tested, though NOT unit tested. I am aware of some bugs surrounding the
        PureString_Replace method, and its also dirt slow, so be wary with that one. PureString_ReplaceChar is plenty
        fast though. <br><br>


        - If weird stuff is happening and you need to see whats getting malloced before the crash, set
        PureStringDoLogging equal to 1, and this will print out all the mallocs I do, as well as their size or if its
        running out of memory. <br><br>

    <p>Snake but each pixel is its own Windows window, shockingly NOT crossplatform. Windows only!</p>

    <blockquote>
        - I wanted to make a stupid but still functional application using my new knowledge of C. I also wanted to learn more about the C Windows API, and I settled on making a game constructed out of windows. My first thought was tetris, however after I solved the problem of displaying and coloring windows, I realized Tetris is hard to program, and that snake would get the same point across while being much easier to program.
